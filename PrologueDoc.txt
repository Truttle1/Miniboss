MINIBOSS CHRONICLES PROLOGUE:

Initial Cutscene
--============--
Begin on NEWS on TV in SODA SHOP

News Anchor: BREAKING URGENT NEWS!

Ships belonging to the evil Fromulons are headed towards Earth.

It is believed that they plan to enslave everyone here and turn Earth into an intergalactic gas station and snack bar.

All hope is lost.

Oh wait, what's this?

Andy Apollo? Guardian of the Skies and Stars!?!?

He's here to save us! An adventure of heroism, action, and wonder is sure to follow him! Man, it would be great if they made a video game about him someday!

*Camera pans to the soda shop, revealing KONRAD and FITZ sitting at a table*

Konrad: Hmmpf... "Andy Apollo"... That guy's always rubbed me the wrong way...
Fitz: And why's that, Buddy?
Konrad: I dunno... Maybe it's because he's always on TV acting so dang perfect all the time... and everything seems to come so easily to him!
Fitz: Well I mean, he is VERY charming on TV, you can't deny that.
Konrad: I know, it's just that... I feel like I have to work SO hard to accomplish even a fraction of what he can... In fact, I can't even accomplish even a fraction of what YOU can!
Fitz: Konrad don't beat yourself up...
Konrad: Easy for you to say, Mr. popular Valedictorian with a full scholarship to Dragonscale University...
Fitz: Hey, being waitlisted is NOT the same as being rejected. Plus, you're WAY more talented than you realize. And speaking of that...
*Fitz pulls out Konrad's calculator*
Fitz: Thanks for letting me borrow your homemade calculator.
Konrad: Hmm... thanks for being so supportive, Big Guy...
Fitz: Don't mention it, Buddy. I'll be here for you whenever you need me... probably at this very soda shop, I don't have any plans for the summer except finally getting to relax.
Konrad: Well then, I best be going. See ya round, Fitz!

KONRAD ENTERS DUMPSTER HOUSE

*Konrad places his calculator on his dresser and lies in bed*

Konrad: Hrmmm... Seriously how does Andy Apollo do it? What do I need to do to... well... at the bare minimum... NOT LIVE IN A DUMPSTER?

*Andy Apollo enters Konrad's house unannounced.*

Konrad: Huh? Wait WHAT THE??!!??
Konrad: Is the secret just braindead confidence and a lack of manners? You're supposed to KNOCK!

*Andy grabs Konrad's calculator off his desk and leaves*

Konrad: WHA!!?!?? HEY!!!

*Konrad runs outside*

Konrad: YOU THERE!!! You are NOT stealing my stuff and getting away with it. You've just made the WORST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE, Space Boy!

BACK IN SODA SHOP, AFTER KONRAD LOSES TO ANDY

*Black screen
Fitz: Konrad? Konrad?!?
*Konrad awakens*
Konrad: Euuughhhhhhh.... Fitz? Where am I?
Fitz: The soda shop.
Konrad: What happened?
Fitz: Well... you had the absolutely genius idea to try beating up Andy Apollo...
Konrad: It's because he's a DIRTY CALCULATOR THIEF!!! Wher'd he go!?
Fitz: He started heading east, towards Bofflebrook. I've heard he's on a quest to build a Fromulon Beacon to board the Fromulon Mothership. He needs a few artifacts in order to build it... I think...
Fitz: But anyway, Bofflebrook is an interesting place. It's much less technologically advanced then we are here in Lepidopolis, plus I've heard that they've been dealing with Kobold raids recently... It makes you feel grateful for living in such a nice city, doesn't it?
Konrad: Well then... that's where I'm going. I've got a score to settle with him now!
Fitz: Dude, that's a terrible idea...
Konrad: That's what they said about a lot of ideas before they turned out well. And besides, I'm getting my calculator back whether Astronaut McBarge-In wants me to or not.
Fitz: Very well... but at least stock up on some drinks before you go. In battle, your energy determines both how strong the attacks you can use are, and how much you can get hurt before passing out.
*Fitz gives Konrad $30*
Konrad: Wow! Thanks a billion, Big Guy!
Fitz: Don't mention it, Buddy... And don't forget to swing by sometimes, I want updates! Plus I'll give you any interesting leads that I find.
